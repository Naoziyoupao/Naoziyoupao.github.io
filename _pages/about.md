Hi, I am **Xuan Zhang**, an undergraduate student at **Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT, China)**.  
I am currently conducting research at the **Research Center for Social Computing and Information Retrieval (SCIR)**.

My research interests include **natural language inference**,and **large language models**, with a particular interest in their applications to **AI for Science**.

## Projects
- **Open PRM Benchmark**:  
  An open benchmark for evaluating **Process Reasoning Models (PRMs)**, aiming to assess their **robustness, consistency, and generalization** across diverse domains.  
  This project focuses on extending PRM evaluation to **multi-disciplinary settings**, including **logical reasoning** and **scientific problem-solving**, with the goal of understanding how PRMs transfer beyond narrow tasks. *(in progress)*

## Publications
